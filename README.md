# RarefiedSystemSolver
Console tool for solving individual case of rarefied systems.

Matrix A is from R ( n x n ), all elements are nils except :
main diagonal, upper diagonal, lower diagonal, k line and k+2 line.

The program solves for X : A * X = F, where X and F are drom R ( n ) with tolerance about N * 10 ^ ( -14 ), where N is from ( 1 ; 9 ).
